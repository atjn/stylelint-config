This is my personal CSS code style, defined as a _[stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)_ shared configuration. My style is:

### Stable
By enforcing certain common practices, my code becomes more readable and less error-prone.
### Loosely styled
I have a loosely defined coding style which helps make the code more consistent and readable. I purposefully don't get too specific with small details because I often find that slightly varying my code style can help me write more efficient and readable code.
